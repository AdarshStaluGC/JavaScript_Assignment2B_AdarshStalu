## 📚 Project Description

The Workout Tracker is a full-stack web application that allows users to register, log in, and manage a list of workouts. Users can add new workouts, edit existing ones, and delete them — implementing complete CRUD functionality. A public-facing view of workouts is available to unauthenticated users in read-only mode.

This app is built using **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB/Mongoose**, and **Handlebars (HBS)** as the templating engine. User authentication is implemented using **Passport.js**, with local login and GitHub OAuth integration.
